# Open Scientific Instrumentation Initiative (OSII)

## Purpose: 

The purpose of this initiative is to develop scientific instrumentation that can be freely built by anyone, using resources available virtually everywhere and following contributions from an open community.

## License: 

A license must be developed, based on GNU public license V3. The projects should be made publicly available through that license.

## Documentation: 

Instrumentation documentation should be available on a public repository, managed by a version control system like GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket. It should include 3D information on an open format, description of methods of fabrication, comments from factories, bills of materials, etc. 

## Community: 

Projects must be downloadable by anyone. 
Anyone can join the community. 
Contributors could communicate through many means, but a official forum should be hosted somewhere online.

## Contributions: 

Contributions could be submitted to the community as suggestions, requirements or as new branches of the project, like any open source software project. Contributors should keep in mind that more and new functionality can be aggregated to the project at any time.

## About the projects: 

Three dimensional CAD projects should be made using a software that can be easily monitored for modifications by a version control system. Please consider using OpenSCAD and use the forum to share your ideas.
 
## The projects should be developed with modularity and scalability in mind. Modules should, whenever possible, be interchangeable.

Each project should be accompanied by CAD files, bill of materials, list of companies that can execute its parts, list of places to buy raw materials, list of contributors etc. The directory structure should follow some very basic template to be developed.

Some basic structural elements, after accepted, should never be changed for that version or all the already developed modules would have to be changed too.

## Project branches: 

New branches can be created following the version control options. Every contributor can download a project, create its own branch and then, maybe, commit it to the main project.

## Interfaces: 

Interfaces should be well thought and developed with scalability, interchangeability and modularity in mind.

## Deadlines: 

Deadlines could be useful, but if something is not converging, ending a branch and starting a new one with basic element modification should be possible and encouraged.

## Seeds: 

A good starting point would be a low temperature equipment, but the main initiative should be able to handle arbitrary seeds.
